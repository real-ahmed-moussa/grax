**GRAX** is a lightweight Python library for transforming geospatial shapefiles into **machine-learning-ready graph networks** using NetworkX.

It automates the full pipeline from **raw GIS data → graph structure → ML-ready inputs**, enabling seamless integration with:

- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)  
- Complex Network Analytics (CNA)  
- Spatial ML models  
- Routing and navigation algorithms  
- Digital twin simulations  
- Infrastructure ML pipelines  

Whether you are building a road network classifier, a pipeline failure predictor, a mobility model, or a full city-scale digital twin, **GRAX converts raw line data into a structured graph with accurate topology and geometry**.

## 📦 Installation

Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install grax
```

## 🔥 Why GRAX?
Most ML/AI models require **structured graph data**, not shapefile polylines.

GRAX bridges this gap by:

- Converting shapefile line geometries into **numerical matrices**
- Automatically detecting intersections using **Shapely**
- Building a **topologically correct NetworkX graph**
- Embedding node attributes (x, y)
- Producing a graph that is directly usable for:
  - PyTorch Geometric  
  - DGL  
  - StellarGraph  
  - NetworkX-based ML  
  - Custom GNN pipelines  

The goal:  
> **Turn raw geospatial networks into graph datasets that you can directly feed into ML models.**

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Converts shapefiles into clean numerical tensors (NumPy matrices)
- ✅ Builds graphs for graph theory and ML tasks
- ✅ Automatic node creation at all intersections (crucial for routing & GNNs)
- ✅ Each node stores geometry → perfect for spatial embeddings
- ✅ Produces NetworkX graphs ready for: node classification/link prediction/graph embeddings/centrality-based ML features
- ✅ Ideal preprocessing step before feeding data into PyTorch Geometric or DGL
- ✅ Designed for digital twins & infrastructure ML (roads, utilities, pipelines)

## 📚 API Reference

### Class `grax`

```python
grax(
      verbose=0      # prints intersection detection logs
)
```

### Function `digitize_shape()`
Converts a list of LineString geometries into ML-friendly numerical matrices.
```python
digitize_shape(shapefile)
```

### Function `create_network()`
Takes digitized matrices and constructs a full-resolution graph with:
- Accurate topology
- Intersection nodes (is_i_j_k)
- Node attributes (x, y)
- Edges representing real connectivity
```python
create_network(L)
```

---

## 🚀 Quickstart: From Shapefile to ML-Ready Graph

```python
from grax import grax

# Initialize GRAX
g = grax(verbose=1)

# Step 1 — Digitize the shapefile
L = g.digitize_shape("city_roads.shp")

# Step 2 — Build the full network graph
G = g.create_network(L)

print("Nodes:", len(G.nodes()))
print("Edges:", len(G.edges()))
```

## 🧠 How GRAX Enables ML

### 1. ML-Ready Node Features
Every node comes with spatial features:
```python
{x: longitude, y: latitude}
```
You can extend this with:
- elevation
- traffic flows
- utility capacity
- population density
- environmental layers

### 2. Topologically Correct Graphs
Many ML tasks require correct topology:
- shortest paths
- flow simulation
- infrastructure interdependency models
- GNNs using neighborhood aggregation
- GRAX ensures that all intersections become actual nodes, which is critical for ML accuracy.

### 3. Perfect for Graph Neural Networks
GNN performance depends on:
- Proper graph structure
- Correct adjacency
- Meaningful node features
- GRAX creates exactly that from raw spatial data.
